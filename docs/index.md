**TAConnect is a desktop application for NUS CS2040 teaching assistants to manage students, sessions, and communication.** While it has a GUI, most interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface) for speed.

* If you are interested in using TAConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing TAConnect, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
